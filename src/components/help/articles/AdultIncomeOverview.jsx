            If you receive income from a room or property that you rent out, you should report the net amount of income. In other words, take the total amount you receive in rent for one month (the gross income), and subtract the monthly cost of maintaining the property. If you have questions or need help figuring out how to estimate maintenance costs, contact {organization.name} ({organization.contact.phone} / {organization.contact.email} / {organization.contact.address}).

        <Topic title="What is an annuity and how do I know if I have income from one?">
          <p>
            An annuity is a series of payments under a contract made at regular intervals over a period of more than one full year. They can be either fixed (under which you receive a definite amount) or variable (not fixed). Annuities can be purchased by individuals alone, or with the help of an employer. If you are unsure whether you have income from an annuity, you should contact {organization.name} ({organization.contact.phone} / {organization.contact.email} / {organization.contact.address}).

        <Topic title="How should I report my income if I work on a seasonal basis?">
          <p>
            If you work on a seasonal basis and your household’s current, gross income is higher or lower than usual and does not fairly or accurately represent your household’s actual circumstances, see the ‘WHAT IF MY INCOME IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME?’ question in the HELP. If you have additional questions, contact [insert contact info, e.g. school/district/person’s name at address, phone number, email], and they will help you figure out your household’s annual rate of income based on USDA guidelines.

        <Topic title="We are in the military. Do we report our income differently?">
          <p>
            Your basic pay and cash bonuses must be reported as income. If you get any cash value allowances for off-base housing, food, or clothing, (including BAH), it must also be included as income. However, if your housing is part of the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, do not include your housing allowance as income. Do not include payments from the Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA). Any additional combat pay resulting from deployment is also excluded from income. If the service member is deployed, include only the portion that is made available by them or on their behalf to the household as income.
