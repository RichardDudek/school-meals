          A household is defined as a group of people, related or unrelated, that usually live together and share income and expenses.
          <br />
          <br />
          This includes grandparents or other extended family members that are living with you. It also includes people that are not currently living with you, but are only away on a temporary basis, like kids that are away at college. It includes people regardless of age or whether they earn or receive income.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you need more detailed information, see the ‘WHO SHOULD I INCLUDE IN MY HOUSEHOLD?’ question in the FAQs.
